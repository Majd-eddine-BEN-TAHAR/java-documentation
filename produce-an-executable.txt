1. compile code using:
    javac SimpleApp.java

2. create MANIFEST.MF and add on it this line and make sure Make sure to a newline at the end of the file:
    Main-Class: SimpleApp 

3. create a JAR file using this command:
    jar cfe SimpleApp.jar SimpleApp SimpleApp*.class
                
                c creates a new JAR file.
                f indicates that you want the output to go to a file rather than to stdout.
                e specifies the entry point for the application, in this case, SimpleApp.
                SimpleApp.jar is the name of the JAR file to create.
                SimpleApp*.class includes SimpleApp.class and any inner class

4. run the jar file :
    java -jar SimpleApp.jar

5. Making the JAR File Executable by double click because by default linux don't allow the execution of a JAR file by double-clicking it directly
    chmod +x SimpleApp.jar

6. Create a desktop entry for your application in ubuntu:
    1. nano nameOfTheApp
    2. add this to the File, and change the path to the jar file and change the icon :
        [Desktop Entry]
        Name=Your application name
        Exec=java -jar /path/to/YourEditorApp.jar
        Icon=/path/to/your-icon.png
        Terminal=false
        Type=Application
        Categories=Utility;
    
    3. move the created file to => ~/.local/share/applications/
